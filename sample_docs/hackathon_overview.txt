Agentic RAG Chatbot Reference

This project demonstrates a production-minded AI assistant with three features:
1) File-grounded Q&A using retrieval augmented generation.
2) Durable selective memory stored in markdown files.
3) Safe weather analytics with Open-Meteo through a restricted execution path.

Retrieval pipeline:
- Ingestion parses uploaded documents.
- Chunking creates overlapping section-aware pieces.
- Hybrid scoring combines BM25 lexical relevance and semantic vector similarity.
- Reranking prioritizes chunks with stronger query-term alignment.

Answering policy:
- The assistant must answer only from retrieved chunks.
- Every answer must include citations that identify source and chunk locator.
- If relevant evidence is missing, it should clearly say it cannot find the answer in uploaded docs.
